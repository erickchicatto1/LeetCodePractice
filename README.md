### Logic & Practice

Welcome! This repository is a dedicated space for improving my **problem-solving skills**, **algorithmic logic**, and mastery of **C++** and **Python**.

The goal of this project is to document my journey through complex data structures, design patterns, and optimization techniques.

### Focused Topics

Currently, I am focusing on the following areas:

### 1. Optimization Techniques
* **Sliding Window:** Efficiently solving subarray problems (e.g., Maximum Sum Subarray) reducing complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$.
* **Two Pointers:** Optimal searching and sorting strategies.

### 2. Design Patterns
* **Finite State Machines (FSM):** * Implementing robust state logic using **C++ Modern Templates** (`std::variant`, `std::visit`).
    * Simplified logic using **Enums and Switch statements**.
    * Dynamic implementations in **Python** using Transition Maps (Dictionaries).

### 3. Language Mastery
* **C++:** Deep dive into Templates, Memory Management, and Modern C++ (C++17/20).
* **Python:** Focusing on "Pythonic" code, dictionary efficiency, and rapid prototyping.

##  Repository Structure

* `/cpp`: Implementations focusing on performance and type safety.
* `/python`: Implementations focusing on readability and dynamic logic.
* `/docs`: My personal notes on why specific algorithms were chosen.

## How to Use
Each folder contains a standalone script. To run the C++ examples, ensure you have a compiler that supports **C++17** or higher.

```bash
# Example for C++
g++ -std=c++17 state_machine.cpp -o state_machine
./state_machine
